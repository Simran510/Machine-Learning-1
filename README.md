🚢 Titanic Dataset Handling (Data Analysis & Preprocessing)
This project involves handling and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning modeling. It focuses on data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and exploring survival patterns based on different passenger attributes.

📊 Project Objective
To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset, handle missing values, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prepare the data for predictive modeling (e.g., survival prediction).

📁 Dataset Source
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

🔧 Tasks Performed
✅ Loaded and explored the dataset
✅ Identified and handled missing values
✅ Visualized key patterns and distributions
✅ Encoded categorical variables
✅ Engineered new features (like family size, title extraction)
✅ Cleaned and prepared the dataset for ML models

🧪 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Insights from EDA
Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) were more likely to survive
Missing values were mainly in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
Title extraction from names helped in better categorization
