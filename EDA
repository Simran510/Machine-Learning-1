🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, sex, ticket fare, class, and whether they survived the disaster. The goal of EDA is to uncover patterns, detect outliers, handle missing data, and understand the relationships between features and survival outcome.

📁 Dataset Overview
Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Key Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

❗ Missing Values
Column	Missing Values	Handling Strategy
Age	~20% missing	Imputed using median or grouped median by Pclass/Sex
Cabin	~77% missing	Dropped or replaced with "Unknown"
Embarked	2 missing	Imputed with mode (most frequent port)

📊 Univariate Analysis
Survival Distribution
~38% of passengers survived.
Data is imbalanced.

Sex
Females had a much higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~19%).

Pclass (Passenger Class)
Higher survival rate in 1st class (~63%) compared to 3rd class (~24%).

Age
Children and young passengers had a better chance of survival.

Used histograms/boxplots to understand distribution.

Fare
Higher fare correlates with higher survival, often associated with better class.

Embarked
Most passengers embarked from port S (Southampton).
Survival rate was highest for passengers from C (Cherbourg).


📈 Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Sex vs. Survived: Clear pattern — most females survived.
Pclass vs. Survived: Survival chances drop as class number increases.
Pclass vs. Age: Younger passengers were mostly in 3rd class.
SibSp/Parch: Having 1–2 family members improved survival; large families had lower survival.

🔧 Feature Engineering (Optional)
Title Extraction: Titles like Mr, Miss, Mrs extracted from Name to capture social status.
Family Size: Combined SibSp and Parch to form FamilySize feature.
IsAlone: Boolean indicating passengers traveling alone.

📌 Key Insights
Gender and class are strong indicators of survival.
Missing values need careful handling, especially for Age.
Feature engineering improves model readiness.
